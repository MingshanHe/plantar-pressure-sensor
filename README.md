# Plantar Pressure Sensor
  This project is used machine learning and data process for evaluating the gaits of person and predicting the next gait.
## Sensors
  The sensor is mainly about the plantar pressure sensor and 6050 angle sensor
## Machine Learning
  I think this project can use most of machine learning and I will try them
